# CNN Training on IPUs

This readme describes how to run CNN models such as ResNet for image recognition training on the IPU.

## Overview

Deep CNN residual learning models such as ResNet are used for image recognition and classification.
The training examples given below use models implemented in TensorFlow 2, optimised for Graphcore's IPU.

## Quick start guide

1. Prepare the TensorFlow environment. Install the Poplar SDK following the instructions in the Getting Started guide
   for your IPU system. Make sure to run the `enable.sh` script for Poplar and activate a Python 3 virtualenv with
   the TensorFlow 2 and IPU TensorFlow Addons wheels from the Poplar SDK installed.
2. Download the data. See below for details on obtaining the datasets.
3. Install the packages required by this application using (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Run the training script. You can check that the code runs with the simplest example:
   `python3 train.py`. See below for optimized instructions and options descriptions.

### Datasets

You can download the ImageNet LSVRC 2012 dataset, which contains about 1.28 million images in 1000 classes,
from http://image-net.org/download or https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data.
It is approximately 150GB for the training and validation sets.

For many other datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 or MNIST datasets, we use TFDS (TensorFlow Datasets)
to load the data, and if it is not present on the disk, it will be automatically downloaded.

## Running and benchmarking

To run a tested and optimised configuration and to reproduce the performance shown on our [performance results page](https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results), please follow the setup instructions in this README to setup the environment, and then use the `examples_utils` module (installed automatically as part of the environment setup) to run one or more benchmarks. For example:

```python
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec <path to benchmarks.yml file>
```

Or to run a specific benchmark in the `benchmarks.yml` file provided:

```python
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec <path to benchmarks.yml file> --benchmark <name of benchmark>
```

For more information on using the examples-utils benchmarking module, please refer to [the README](https://github.com/graphcore/examples-utils/blob/master/examples_utils/benchmarks/README.md).

## Executing training only or validation only

By default, the application will execute training and afterwards it will validate all model checkpoints produced during training. You can disable any of these two phases if necessary. To disable validation, just append `--validation False` to your instruction. This terminates the program immediately after training finishes. Similarly, if you want to disable training, just append `--training False` to your instruction. Note that by default, when training is disabled, validation will be done on a randomly initialized model. However, you can additionally specify a directory of checkpoints, with `--checkpoint-dir your_previously_generated_directory`, to run validation on the previously trained model without training the model any further.


## Configuration files

As can be observed from the above, the application provides a number of options to efficiently target execution on the IPUs. To facilitate building complex instructions, the user can instead write the instruction in a configuration file. The configuration is defined in YAML format. See `configs.yml` configuration file for examples of configuration instructions. After a configuration is specified you can use the configuration simply with:  
    `python3 train.py --config your_config --config-path your_config_file`

To facilitate experimentation, you can also overload specific parameters of a configuration directly from the command line:  
    `python3 train.py --config your_config --config-path your_config_file --some-param new_value`


## Periodic host events
While the bulk of the work is done by the IPUs, there are a number of operations we may want to do on the host CPU throughout the training run, such as logging or saving a checkpoint of the model. How often we want to execute these events has an impact on the throughput of the application. This is because the application is built in a way that the program to be executed on the IPUs is wrapped in a loop such that multiple iterations of the program can be performed on the IPUs before handing back control to the host CPU. By minimizing the handover between the IPUs and the host CPU we can reduce the total execution time of the program. The number of iterations executed on the IPUs can be adjusted to match the period of the host events.  

Note that depending on dataset size and batch configuration, not all frequency values are valid. More specifically, the switching from the IPU to the CPU must happen after a weight update has been completed. For example, a given dataset and batch configuration result in an odd number of weight updates per epoch, it is not possible to log the training metrics 2 times per epoch, because one of the events would happen in the middle of a weight update. To avoid these situations and to facilitate the user experience, the program automatically calculates the closest possible frequency that doesn't attempt to interrupt a weight update. However it is possible that the corresponding event is executed at a higher or lower frequency than originally requested.

Some examples of adjusting the frequency of logging the state of the training run over time:  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 6 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 1`  
Sets steps per execution such that it executes one entire epoch on the device before returning to the host, while printing one log per epoch.  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 6 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 2`  
It's not possible to execute half an epoch on the device because it would correspond to a partial weight update. It will execute 1 epoch on the device and print 1 log per epoch. It logs a warning to the user highlighting the logging frequency can't be executed and will be adjusted.  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 6 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 10`  
It's not possible to execute 1/10 of an epoch on the device. The closest is 1/11. So the generated program executes 1/11 of an epoch before returning to the host and therefore 11 logs per epoch. A warning is logged.  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 6 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 1/2`  
The generated program is going to execute 2 epochs on the device before returning to the host. Therefore the program is only repeated for 3 times.  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 6 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 1/3`
The generated program is going to execute 3 epochs on the device before returning to the host. Therefore the program is only repeated for 2 times.  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 5 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 1/2`  
An exception is raised: "ValueError: It is not possible to log 2.0 epochs a time for 5 epochs".  

`python3 train.py --model cifar_resnet8 --num-epochs 6 --precision 16.16 --micro-batch-size 8 --validation False --half-partials True --gradient-accumulation 8 --logs-per-epoch 0`  
The entire training run is executed on the device and a warning message is logged so the user is notified.  


## Synthetic data

It is possible to execute the training program without a real dataset and instead using synthetic data. This is done by using the `--synthetic-data` option. When using synthetic data, the data can be generated on the host CPU and transferred to the IPU or the data can be generated directly on the IPU avoiding the need for any data transfer between the CPU and the IPU. To generate synthetic data on the CPU use `--synthetic-data cpu`, and to generate synthetic data on the IPU use `--synthetic-data ipu`.


## PopDist and PopRun - distributed training on IPU-PODs

To get the most performance from our IPU-PODs, this application example now supports PopDist, Graphcore Poplar
distributed configuration library. For more information about PopDist and PopRun, see the [User Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poprun-user-guide/).

A very simple example of using distributed training can be done with:

    poprun --num-instances 16 --num-replicas 16 python3 train.py

Each instance sets an independent input data feed to the devices. The maximum number of instances is limited by
the number of replicas, in this case 16. A side effect from this is that when executing distributed workloads,
the program option `--num-replicas value` is ignored.

Note that the default behaviour when combining distributed training and pipelined model will not work. By default, the app takes a pipelined training model and assumes the model fits in a single IPU during training. This means that the number of replicas changes between training and validation. While this improves performance, it is incompatible with distributed training which expects a constant number of replicas and ipus per replica throughout the program execution. So avoid this limitation we provide a `--pipeline-validation-model` command line option which uses the same the pipeline splits in training and validation:

    poprun --num-instance X --num-replicas Y --ipus-per-replica Z python3 train.py --pipeline-splits split1 ... splitN --pipeline-validation-model

## Regularization
The application allows to apply the squared norm of the weights to the loss in two ways, which are `--weight-decay <lambda>` and `--l2-regularization <lambda>`. They are mathematically equivalent when applied to stateless optimisers (e.g. SGD without the momentum), however, for stateful optimisers they behave differently. `--l2-regularization` affects the optimiser state directly, whereas `--weight-decay` doesn't, i. e.:
- weight decay:  `delta_W = -lr*(O(dL/dW, s) + lambda*W)`
- L2 regularization:  `delta_W = -lr*(O(dL/dW + lambda*W, s)`

where `L` is the loss with respect to weights `W`, `O` is an optimizer with state `s` and `lambda` is the regularization coefficient.

## Convergence optimized configurations

### ImageNet - ResNet-50

The following configuration trains ResNet50 using 16 Mk2 IPUs. The model is split over 4 IPUs and executed according to a pipeline execution scheme. The model weights and computation are represented using 16 bit floating point numbers, and matmuls and convolutions partials are also computed in the same representation. With the above settings it is possible to fit on each IPU a micro batch size of 16 samples. Additionally the model is replicated 4 times (4 pipeline stages * 4 replicas = 16 IPUs), and gradients are accumulated 128 times, therefore each weight update corresponds to a global batch size of 8192 samples (16 micro-batch * 4 replicas * 128 gradient accumulation). The model is optimized for 100 epochs with SGD+Momentum, with a momentum value of 0.9, and L2 regularization of value 0.0001. A cosine learning rate is also used for entire duration of training, and the learnig rate is warmed-up for the first 5 epochs of training for additional training stability.

For ease of use, the entire instruction is implemented in the default configuration file (`configs.yml`), named `resnet50_16ipus_8k_bn_pipeline` and can be easily reproduced with the following command:    
    `python3 train.py --config resnet50_16ipus_8k_bn_pipeline`

## Exporting trained model in SavedModel format for TensorFlow Serving

Following the training and validation runs, `export_for_serving.py` script can be used to export a model to SavedModel format, which can be subsequently deployed to TensorFlow Serving instances and thus made available for inference. The model should be defined using the same options or configuration file that have been provided to `train.py` for training.
The following command line creates a SavedModel containing Resnet50 with weights initialized from `checkpoint.h5` file:
    `python3 scripts/export_for_serving.py --config resnet50_16ipus_8k_bn_pipeline  --export-dir="./resnet50_for_serving/001" --micro-batch-size=1  --checkpoint-file=checkpoint.h5 --keep-pipeline-model=False --iterations=128`

Please keep in mind that the exported SavedModel can't be used to load the model back into a TensorFlow script, as it only contains the IPU runtime op and an opaque executable and no model state.

                        Path to the directory where the SavedModel will be written. (default: None)
                        
  --iterations ITERATIONS  
                        Number of iterations for the model exported for TensorFlow Serving. (default: 1)
                        
  --pipeline-serving-model PIPELINE_SERVING_MODEL  
                        Reuse the training pipeline splits for inference in the model exported for TensorFlow Serving (default: False)
                        
  --checkpoint-file CHECKPOINT_FILE  
                        Path to a checkpoint file that will be loaded before exporting model for TensorFlow Serving. If not set, the model will use randomly initialized parameters. (default: None)


### TensorFlow Serving example

Example of TensorFlow Serving usage can be found in `send_request.py` file. Script exports selected model to SavedModel format, initializes serving server, and sends images to server for predictions. Execution ends after given number of prediction requests. The model should be defined using the same options or configuration file that have been provided to `train.py` for training.

Basic usage example for Resnet50 model export in batch-size 16 and serving in batch-size 8: 
    `python3 send_request.py --config resnet50_infer_bs16 --dataset-path $DATASETS_DIR/imagenet-data --batch-size 8 --port 8502 --num-threads 32`

### Additional arguments for send_request.py script

   --port PORT  
                        Serving service acces port
                        
   --batch-size BATCH_SIZE 
                        Size of data batch used in single prediction request. Might be smaller than global-batch-size of exported model
                        
   --num-threads NUM_THREADS  
                        Number of threads/processes used for prediction requests, optimal value depends from used model and host system specification
                        
   --num-images NUM_IMAGES  
                        Number of image prediction requests
                        
   --serving-bin-path SERVING_BIN_PATH  
                        Path to TensorFlow serving binary file
                        
   --use-async  
                        When enabled client will send next prediction requests without blocking/waitg for server response. Each request returns `Future Object`
                        
   --verbose  
                        Enables printing of each request execution time. Expect degradation in overall performace caused by printing
