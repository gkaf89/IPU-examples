## Overview of the Architectures <a name='overview' ></a>

In this repository, we use the Graphcore IPU to implement a few popular graph neural network architectures.

For training, `--model==graph_isomorphism` uses a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)[1]. `--model==graph_network` uses a Graph Network[2], and `--model=interaction_network` implements an Interaction Network[3]. These are all used to predict chemical properties of molecules on the IPU.

The script `run_training.py` runs and evaluates training. This repository is written in TensorFlow 2 and uses Keras extensively.

This repository supports training, evaluation, and benchmarking the throughput.

## Setup <a name='setup' ></a>

Create a virtual environment and install the appropriate Graphcore TensorFlow 2 wheels from inside
the SDK directory:

```shell
virtualenv --python python3.6 .gcn_venv
source .gcn_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install <path to the TensorFlow-2 wheel from the Poplar SDK>
pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps <path to the Keras wheel from the Poplar SDK>
pip install <path to the ipu_tensorflow_addons wheel for TensorFlow 2 from the Poplar SDK>
```

Our IPU implementation uses a TensorFlow custom op that has to be compiled prior to use.
First, make sure you have sourced your TensorFlow environment, then from
your top directory (the one containing this README) run
`cd static_ops && make && cd -`.

### Quick-start

To train a Graph Isomorphism Network, run:

```shell
python run_training.py --model=graph_isomorphism --n_graph_layers=5  --nodes_dropout=0.1
```

This should get a test AUC of slightly above 0.75.

## Dataset <a name='dataset' ></a>

This example trains using the Open Graph Benchmark [4] — specifically, the `molhiv` dataset. This contains over 40,000 molecules. The machine learning task is to predict whether a molecule inhibits HIV replication.

The leaderboard for this task is found [here](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_graphprop/).

### Model Details <a name='model' ></a>

To integrate the use of edges (i.e. the information from atomic bonds), we follow [5] and embed the edges afresh at each layer. These embedded edges are combined with the neighborhood aggregation from the nodes.

We used similar parameters to the example in [5], but use Layer Normalization instead of Batch Normalization at the hidden layers of the multi-layer perceptrons.

### Performance <a name='performance' ></a>

We compare our model with the GIN implemented on the [OGB leaderboard](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_graphprop/#ogbg-molhiv). As per the instructions, training is performed 10 times and the results reported.

The command used is: `python run_training.py --micro_batch_size=24 --cosine_lr=True --epochs=150  --nodes_dropout=.1`, which uses FP16 training.

The test results are consistent with the reported results.

| Model | Parameters | Test ROC-AUC | Validation ROC-AUC |
|----|----|----|----|
| GIN on leaderboard | 1,885,206| 0.7558 ± 0.0140 | 0.8232 ± 0.0090 |
| IPU GIN model | 1,708,106 | 0.7574 ± 0.0215 | 0.7915 ± 0.0114|

## Running and benchmarking

To run a tested and optimised configuration and to reproduce the performance shown on our [performance results page](https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results), please follow the setup instructions in this README to setup the environment, and then use the `examples_utils` module (installed automatically as part of the environment setup) to run one or more benchmarks. For example:

```python
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec <path to benchmarks.yml file>
```

Or to run a specific benchmark in the `benchmarks.yml` file provided:

```python
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec <path to benchmarks.yml file> --benchmark <name of benchmark>
```

For more information on using the examples-utils benchmarking module, please refer to [the README](https://github.com/graphcore/examples-utils/blob/master/examples_utils/benchmarks/README.md).

## Changelog <a name='changelog' ></a>

`June 2022`: This repository now implements *grouped* gathers and scatters: i.e. the compiler
is fully aware that each member of the batch can only communicate within its own
batch. To use this efficiently, we concatenate several graphs into each member
of the batch. The `packing_strategy_finder` plans the packing so as to minimise
padding. Using this grouping improves our throughput.
