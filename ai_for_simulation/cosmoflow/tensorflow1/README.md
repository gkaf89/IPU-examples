## How to use this code example

1. Prepare the IPU environment.

 - Download, install & activate the Poplar SDK following instructions provided in the Getting Started document
	
 - Create python virtual environment, install the tensorflow-1 wheel from the Poplar SDK and active the Python
   environment. This is also documented in the Getting Started guide. This example uses TensorFlow v1, so
   please ensure your Python venv has TFv1 installed. 


2. Start running the example with one of the following commands:

 - run without tensorflow estimator, with 1 IPU:
   `python train.py configs/graphcore.yaml`

 - run without tensorflow estimator, with 2 IPUs:
   The workload is heavily IO bound, so merely increasing IPUs without increasing CPU numa-aware threads to pre-process
   the dataset will show marginal scalability. We use poprun to increase threads involved in processing
   `poprun --num-replicas 2 --num-instances 2 --ipus-per-replica 1 python train.py configs/graphcore.yaml`

 - run with tensorflow estimator, with 1 IPU:
   `python train.py configs/graphcore.yaml --use-estimator`

 - run with tensorflow estimator, with 2 IPUs:
   `poprun --num-replicas 2 --num-instances 2 --ipus-per-replica 1 python train.py configs/graphcore.yaml --use-estimator`
